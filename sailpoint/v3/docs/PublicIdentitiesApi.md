Get a list of public identities

### Example

* OAuth Authentication (UserContextAuth):
* OAuth Authentication (UserContextAuth):

```python
import sailpoint.v3
from sailpoint.v3.models.public_identity import PublicIdentity
from sailpoint.v3.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/v3
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = sailpoint.v3.Configuration(
    host = "https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/v3"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with sailpoint.v3.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = sailpoint.v3.PublicIdentitiesApi(api_client)
    limit = 250 # int | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to 250)
    offset = 0 # int | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to 0)
    count = False # bool | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to False)
    filters = 'firstname eq \"John\"' # str | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in*  **alias**: *eq, sw*  **email**: *eq, sw*  **firstname**: *eq, sw*  **lastname**: *eq, sw* (optional)
    add_core_filters = False # bool | If *true*, only get identities which satisfy ALL the following criteria in addition to any criteria specified by *filters*:   - Should be either correlated or protected.   - Should not be \"spadmin\" or \"cloudadmin\".   - uid should not be null.   - lastname should not be null.   - email should not be null. (optional) (default to False)
    sorters = 'name' # str | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **name** (optional)

    try:
        # Get a list of public identities
        api_response = api_instance.get_public_identities(limit=limit, offset=offset, count=count, filters=filters, add_core_filters=add_core_filters, sorters=sorters)
        print("The response of PublicIdentitiesApi->get_public_identities:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling PublicIdentitiesApi->get_public_identities: %s\n" % e)
