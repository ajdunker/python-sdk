# **create_role**
> Role create_role(role)

Create a Role

This API creates a role. You must have a token with API, ORG_ADMIN, ROLE_ADMIN, or ROLE_SUBADMIN authority to call this API.  In addition, a ROLE_SUBADMIN may not create a role including an access profile if that access profile is associated with a source the ROLE_SUBADMIN is not associated with themselves.  The maximum supported length for the description field is 2000 characters. Longer descriptions will be preserved for existing roles. However, any new roles as well as any updates to existing descriptions will be limited to 2000 characters.

# **patch_role**
> Role patch_role(id, json_patch_operation)

Patch a specified Role

This API updates an existing Role using [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) syntax.  The following fields are patchable: **name**, **description**, **enabled**, **owner**, **accessProfiles**, **membership**, **requestable**, **accessRequestConfig**, **revokeRequestConfig**, **segments** A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, ROLE_ADMIN, or ROLE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API. In addition, a token with ROLE_SUBADMIN authority may only call this API if all Access Profiles included in the Role are associated to Sources with management workgroups of which the ROLE_SUBADMIN is a member. The maximum supported length for the description field is 2000 characters. Longer descriptions will be preserved for existing roles, however, any new roles as well as any updates to existing descriptions will be limited to 2000 characters.
