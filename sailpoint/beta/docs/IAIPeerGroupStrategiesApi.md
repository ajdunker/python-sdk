Identity Outliers List

-- Deprecated : See 'IAI Outliers' This API will be used by Identity Governance systems to identify identities that are not included in an organization's peer groups. By default, 250 identities are returned. You can specify between 1 and 1000 number of identities that can be returned.

### Example

* OAuth Authentication (UserContextAuth):
* OAuth Authentication (UserContextAuth):
```python
import time
import os
import sailpoint.beta
from sailpoint.beta.models.peer_group_member import PeerGroupMember
from sailpoint.beta.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/beta
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = sailpoint.beta.Configuration(
    host = "https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/beta"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with sailpoint.beta.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = sailpoint.beta.IAIPeerGroupStrategiesApi(api_client)
    strategy = 'entitlement' # str | The strategy used to create peer groups. Currently, 'entitlement' is supported.
    limit = 250 # int | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to 250)
    offset = 0 # int | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to 0)
    count = False # bool | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to False)

    try:
        # Identity Outliers List
        api_response = api_instance.get_peer_group_outliers(strategy, limit=limit, offset=offset, count=count)
        print("The response of IAIPeerGroupStrategiesApi->get_peer_group_outliers:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling IAIPeerGroupStrategiesApi->get_peer_group_outliers: %s\n" % e)
```
